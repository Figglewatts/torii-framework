# Torii Framework
A framework for Unity 2019.4+. Basically trying to make my life easier.

## Usage
Torii is super easy to use. It comes as a Unity package, and even has a project
template that comes with it preinstalled.

The easiest way to get up and running is to download the project template and
install it in Unity, then create a new Unity project from the template.

Download the file `com.figglewatts.torii.template.tgz` from the releases
section of this repository, and place it in the following folder in your
Unity installation: `{editor-path}/Editor/Data/Resources/PackageManager/ProjectTemplates`.

Now, when you create a new project in Unity the option for a Torii Project will
be there. If you create a project with this template, then Unity will install
the Torii package for you! Easy.

Torii has a dedicated CLI application for integrating with its projects too.
You can find ToriiCLI here: https://github.com/Figglewatts/toriicli

With ToriiCLI you can build, release, and even
manage NuGet packages for your project. Try it out!
